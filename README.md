## Cleaning the Samsung Data set - Explanations and instructions 

This repository contains a script called run_analysis.R
saving the script and running it from a folder that contains the unzipped data (e.g the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder)
will tidy up the data, select the mean and std variables and save it to a variable called relaventFeaturesFromData
The last two columns are the Activity name and subject number.

The summarized data is saved to a variable called SummerizedData
and this data is also written to a file called SummerizedData.txt which would be saved to the folder of the script
